# This file can be empty or used to import router modules for easier access.
# For example, if you had multiple router files in this directory:
#
# from . import hf_models
# from . import other_router
#
# __all__ = ["hf_models", "other_router"]

# For our current structure, it's fine to be empty.
# main.py directly imports from .routers.hf_models
