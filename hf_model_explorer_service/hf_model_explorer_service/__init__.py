# This file can be empty, or used to mark the directory as a package.
# You could also put application-wide initializations here if needed,
# but for this project, main.py handles app setup.
# For example, you might expose the app instance or settings from here.

# from .main import app
# from .config import settings

# __all__ = ["app", "settings"]
