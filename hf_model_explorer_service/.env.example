# Example .env file for hf_model_explorer_service

# Optional: Your Hugging Face User Access Token (read-only is usually sufficient for public models)
# If you need to access private models or perform actions requiring authentication,
# you might need a token with write permissions.
# You can generate a token from your Hugging Face account settings: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
# HF_TOKEN="your_hugging_face_token_here"

# Note: If HF_TOKEN is not set, the huggingface_hub library will operate in anonymous mode,
# which might have rate limits or restrictions on accessing certain information.

# For local development with Uvicorn, you can set other environment variables here if needed.
# For example, if your application used a database:
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
